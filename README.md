# Houdini Flat Themes

Flat themes for Houdini, to be easier on the eye.

## Installation

Copy the `*.inc` and `*.hcs` files to the `config` subfolder (you can just create it if it's not there yet) in your Houdini user folder (typically `$HOME/houdini19.5` or similar). 

## Usage

Copy the files to install, then go to Edit > Color Settings and choose the new theme from the dropdown.

## Status

These themes are very usable, but probably an ongoing work in progress.

Some cleanup would be needed, as the themes probably contain a lot of uneeded lines. Also, additional comments to aid in identifying which UI element corresponds to what are needed.
